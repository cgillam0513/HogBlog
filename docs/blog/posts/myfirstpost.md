title: "Why I'm Switching To Machine Learning"
---

## Background

In late September, I was laid off from Texas Instruments, where I was a Software Developer for 13 years.  I developed math algorithms for the TI calculators, as well as create Python scripts to automate the collection, analysis, and visualization of code quality metrics.  

Ater taking a little break (to move into a new town and house), I started looking for new jobs and simultaneously work on a new iOS project.  For years, I had a desire to create an app which read historical markers, as I drove past them.  I had drove past numerous historical markers as I travelled and moved across the US, and I was always curious, but never had the time to stop.  Thus, I felt like this was a perfect time to work on this app.

On January 8, I released the first version of my app, with just Texas data.  I gradually then released updates which included Florida and South Carolina.  While working on this app, I sadly noticed that another app, ExploreHere, did something very similar.  This was quite discouraging.  Furthermore, the downloads of the app were slow, and the subscriptions were even lower.

While I was working on the app, I was also applying for jobs.  After applying to an estimated 100 jobs, I had 0 callbacks.  Tech layoffs were on the rise, largely due to AI.  This was also discouraging.  

## Where I Am Now
I turned to chatGPT as a career coach (possibly a bad idea), and I tried to brainstorm how to get more interviews, stand out as a candidate, and/or find new career choices.  I went through multiple scenarios ... actuary, other app development, contract work, embedded software developer, etc.  I weighed multiple factors, such as additional education, job availability, job/personal satisfaction, and salary.  After going through multiple scenarios, it appeared that my skills, math + software development, was a perfect match for machine learning engineer.  On top of that, I had a lot of data with my historical maker app.  Thus, I decided to make a decision.  I'm going to dedicate my time, not on the app, but on learning machine learning with my historical marker data.

## What’s Next
- Finding the right learning material
- Cleaning the data
- Right tools for the job
